many potoc many potoc programing

1 the probuctivity for : many potoc can use many core for execute program in async format that givy more fast program
2 Efectivly uslas resours: efectively using potoc give you opportunity optrmaithe proces time and operation memorie
3 upgrate reactivyti program: apgrate reacrivyty program using potoc can help you in problem plaking that hellp program more fast and more efectively
4 issaly program script: Some task can by harsd for how in step by step can isaly dor many potoc

//Web development

many poroces programing in java script
1.Web workers: give you oportunity script in different potoc whot counting paralel with main potoc wed application
(var appwork = new Worker('worker.js'))
appwork.post+Message('hi')
2.Promises:(Ecma6): give opportunity working with async code and get notification web he stopt(promis use than)
3.Collbaks: function other side call using for async operating that after call(100% execute after function)


many procces programing you can realize different way tje first calss (thread) without class you cant execute code
...Critical section code its type of code that have () working with resoura data, wen potoc going in critical section cant go in critical section then first dont stop working 

////working section stop the runing the together resurses
/////semafor - its construction senhronithation that using in paralelal programing for configure acception resour or critical section code with potoc(construction sinhronithation)

Mutex - 
mutual exclution: vsimo diseble acception this construction using organithation acception for resurcrc with different potoc in many potoc cicle, maine idia its muted can by blok only one potoc in any moment time, athe potoc that try to get mutex will wite wen he dont de free(mutex and semafor)


Model(TCP/ OSI)

Fix

gitHUB its: service for work together work for program its give you oportynity save different version your script

Why its good?:
1 work together: git give opartunity together work on one project. git can look like onlyne box for code.
2 See changes in script (git) system control git, github give oportunity to see changes in script and roback to old version.
3 Developer comunity: 
4 Tool for working(system check the problem) comunication about code and oportunity to change script
5 integaration with different servicess (platform)


Privet data:
1 git hut not olwes give 100 procent security you data insaide the script (but this function can be for money)
2 dependensy from internet and github (if was wrong all data you lose) 


//
repositori: its load system sersions (link)

Plan for reposirori:
Comand: git_clone url_project; //you will work with this repositori

new relation vesion: git checkout -b bname;

And changes: git add

Changes:git commit -m 'Description'

Push in relation: git push origin Bname

For publish: git checkut bname

Get changes: git merge bname

Packedg Java: its organithatuion 1 in langege programing java which alow groping class, interfase, down packedg, othe peckadge, other for usefyl using code
And paket java: its the some container for class java which in current time have him cintainer with name. Packedg using for organithation program on level file systen, which allow workaround problem name and simplifay development big program 
packedg allow: use modyling stracter, for more understendibul and one more exec code. By seem packedg all class project create by grope which named packedg.
Name class need to be the uniq only in framework packedg.
For introduse packedg need in file discription class, that will be in this pacedge the first command will be write instaction: packege mypach {mypack its name packege} if packedge with this name alredy have and particular class / class from file willde add for this packedge, one instraction packedg can using in many file,but in one file can be one packedg, interfase have 

interfase and seemd from class: that contains only signatyra method withot description and field - constant (methos witot realithation) in othe class cas realythe this interfase, and need to have realithation all methods all method discrabing interfase
interfase using for creating abstraction stucoring code they alow break specification whot class can need to to and realithation (have the do this whith allow flexabilyti and working code). have we say pacedge can heve relation pacedg. when push the name relation pacedg use bot sysntax (dot-walking) when after pacedg we add name pacedg
Were impornatant role java : hierachy pacedge need to seems stracter file system

work whith interfase:
java.awt.image

file unter relation pacedg
java/awt/imege

from practical one of the most important whith work pacedg - have schema access by class from calculation location by packedg

1.whot its OOP And why its: its usful when for more redebal code and optimithation one of maine function ()
2Whot its class: its type data which work discride the object 
3And object class: object discrybe class can discrype particular methaod
4 Constructor and destruktor: constructor worhind for create object on function/ destructor clear all
5Incapsulation,  Polimarfism, Inheritance: in object will be the save all methods,
Incapsulation:
polimarfism:
Inheritance: this type can helpe the get property from super class they can gey the value


^Reload methods: they are reload page
7Interfase: dont have realithation

OOP
29.04.24

Virtual methaod: its method in class which can be repick in down class. have some difference bitvin abstract and virtual method in OOP
1. Virtual method 1.1 its mehod in class which can be repick in class
1.2 use in contexti languge which use polimorfithm and allow redeclared methos in down class
1.3 the declared in base class but can be redeclared in down class in need 

exmple:
class Glads {

    chanhe: function{

    }
}

class fail Extend Glads{

    change: function{//can execute differen code execute

    }

}


2 Abstract method:

2.1 its methos in class which cant have realithation in base class an dneed be redeclared in down class
2.2 Use for create interfase for down class 
2.3 Use in languge which allow abstractiob class (java, pythos, C#, C++)

teg <form> have 2 important thing its (action ='your script'  method= POST,GET)
if you wont get data from form in code mehanithm php use method $_POST, $GET
]

[
for php mehanithm can get particular parameter from form in teg insaide form need create atribute name
if i wont get walue from forn need use $_POSR = ['password']
step:
get parameter fron form 
push this value into php

php create mysql request data

for creta esql request use method query object mysqlI

exemple request:
$result = $con(constructor) = query($sql);//connection
$row = $resolt

it this exemple method fetch_assoc() get one lne from resoult execute sql request and writhe resoult into veriable $row and varibel row its have access record insaide table 
exemple:
mysql:[name: user, password: pass1]
$row = [name]; //get name from mysql

//get from form
$pass = $_POST['password'];
//get from mysql
pass = $row['password]

if(pass = pass)

for compare password from form and mysql use the method password werifai which give password for com
e
parepassword_verifay('p1,p2);
but save password in open view in table sql its not secure.
its give opportynity hackers have access into sql can get all password withou problem
And password saving like hash;
for creat hash with open password use function password hash 
exemple:
password_hash(p1,hash)

in resoult can write in variable and ofter request into sql

PASSWORD_DECRIPT = [count = 12]// cretate function which shifr

filter anfularjs
filter its function whith regoing data (how simple and hard "array", 'collection') its say that with big data its give more execution time - in this more good in this situation caning format data model 

collection = object, class, hrd type
Filter can be 2 maine cotegiri:
1) filter simple data and complexity
angularjs have 
recange symvol into upercade
2)lowecase
3)limitTo
like this 3 filter use for data type string but filter limit to can be use for integer in this situation willbe recanhe integer inro string, filter limt_TO cut value into particuler limit;
4)currency regabge into currency
5) date form value data 
6) JSON rechange data into JSON
7)linky: need to use module ngSanitith this filter search link into text which dont have active links and rechange thay in active and add him in teg <a>
https//:google.com
exemple: <a href = 'https//:google.com'>

Filter can be use on side view (templet) and in js exemple syntax:
